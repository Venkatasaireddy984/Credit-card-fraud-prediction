# Credit-card-fraud-prediction
This Credit Card Fraud Detection project seeks to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in a highly skewed dataset in which only a small percentage of transactions are fraudulent. The dataset contains approximately 284,000 credit card transactions with anonymised attributes, enabling for detailed research without privacy concerns.
The project includes numerous important procedures for preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling data in order to efficiently detect fraud. Data cleansing, feature scaling, and class imbalance resolution using techniques such as SMOTE and class weight adjustments are all critical aspects. A variety of models will be evaluated, with decision trees. Performance will be measured using measures such as precision, recall, and F1-score, with an emphasis on reducing false positives while increasing fraud detection accuracy.
